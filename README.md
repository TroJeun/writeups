# CTF Writeups

Welcome to the **Writeups** repository! This repo contains solutions and explanations for various Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges and events which we played.

## 📁 Structure

Writeups are organized as follows:
```
📂 Event_Name/
 ├── 📂 CategoryName/
 │       ├── challenge_description.me
 │       ├── 📂 attachments/
 │       ├── writeup.me
```
Each challenge is stored under its respective event and category, making it easy to navigate and find solutions.

### 🔍 Breakdown
1. **📂 Event_Name/**  
   - Represents the name of the CTF event (e.g., `pearlCTF2025/` or `GoogleCTF2024/`).  
   - Each event has its own directory to keep writeups organized.  

2. **📂 CategoryName/**  
   - CTF challenges are grouped into categories like `Crypto/`, `Pwn/`, `Web/`, etc.  
   - This helps in organizing challenges based on their type.

3. **📝 challenge_description.me**  
   - A file containing the original problem statement, hints, or any details given in the challenge.  
   - Helps to understand what the challenge was about before diving into the solution.  

4. **📂 attachments/**  
   - A folder that stores any additional files related to the challenge (e.g., binaries, scripts, images, or PCAP files).  
   - Keeps resources structured and prevents clutter.

5. **📝 writeup.me**  
   - The actual solution and explanation of how the challenge was solved.
